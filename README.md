# zal
Javascript's a cool language, don't get me wrong. I love JS. But we need some more Zalgo, y'know.

Enter zal. Now you can write Zalgo your Javascript to spice things up a bit and make your code easier to read for the hive mind...

# Usage
After including `zal.js` wherever you want/need, simply call `zal.encode` (to encode JS in Zalgo) or `zal.decode` (to decode Zalgo'd JS).
